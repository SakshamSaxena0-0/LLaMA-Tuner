# LLaMA-Tuner

LLaMA-Tuner is a project for fine-tuning the LLaMA model on a custom dataset. This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and supplementary scripts needed to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance using Google Colab.

## Overview

The project leverages the LLaMA model architecture to perform fine-tuning on a custom dataset. It demonstrates:
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Steps to ingest and clean your dataset.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Code to adjust the LLaMA model parameters using transfer learning.
- **Evaluation:** Techniques to monitor training performance and validate the tuned model.
- **Deployment:** Guidelines for saving and using the fine-tuned model for inference.
